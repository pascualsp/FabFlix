This project was made as part of UCI's 122B (Project in Databases and Web Applications) course. 
FabFlix is a fullstack e-commerce movie website that allows users to search, browse and purchase movies. 
The project was completed in 10 weeks with the help of my partner, My Lynn Huynh. Unfortunately our 
AWS instances for this project are no longer running so this repository is more for archival purposes.
